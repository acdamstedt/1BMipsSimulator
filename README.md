# 1BMipsSimulator
By Annika Damstedt

A MIPS Simulator created in Winter 2024 for CMPTGCS 1B.

Notes:

  *Got most of the MIPS commands working, but not all of them

  *To use, edit the mipsSimulator.txt file and run the mipsSimulator.cpp file

  *mipsSimulator.txt currently has a program that demonstrates how string and jump commands were implemented

  *Didn't figure out (although I tried) how to get signed integers to work, so any instructions with unsigned counterparts work identically
  
  *I got jumps and strings working, but I don't think it's in the same way as MIPS (although I think my system works pretty good)
  
  *I ran out of time to add these instructions: lw, sw, lhu, sh, lbu, sb. Everything else took me a really long time. I wish I could've added lw and sw, but the other   instructions were things I've never used and I'm not sure if I would have included them with more time (I would have still tried). 
  
  *Most importantly, this was a really fun project and I learned a lot about MIPS. It helped me understand how the assembly language is really similar to the machine language, which in turn helps me understand what certain hex commands do in MIPS fairly quick. Also, there were some interesting puzzles which I had to overcome, and while I didn't make as much progress as I would have liked, every challenge I did overcome helped me learn a whole lot. So thanks for assigning the great project. If you teach this class again in future quarters, I hope you keep this project around.
